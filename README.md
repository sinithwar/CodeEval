# CodeEval
A container for most of my CodeEval Solutions
These are the computer held solutions for my CodeEval problems. Most of them will work by default, but ones that do not work
are the ones that I had problems with. This is to store my solutions for later use and to let people see where they can derive
their answers from.

Why are most of these in Ruby?
Ruby is my first and most favorite language. I will upload solutions in other languages later on, but I practice Ruby
the most.

Why do some of your integer solutions require "\n" in the equation?
An annoying fact that I came across in CodeEval is that the file is contained, assumingly, inside of an HTML tag requiring a new line.
In order to completely solve solution, I had to sometimes account for that new line.
